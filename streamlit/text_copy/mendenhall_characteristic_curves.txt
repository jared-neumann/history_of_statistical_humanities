<div style="text-align: justify;"><p>Augustus DeMorgan somewhere remarks (I think it is in his 'Budget of paradoxes') that some time somebody will institute a comparison among writers in regard to the average length of  words used in composition, and that it may be found possible to identify the author of a book, a poem, or a play, in this way.</p></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><p>In reflecting upon this remark at various times within the past five or six years, always with the determination to test the value of the suggestion whenever time for the work seemed available, a more comprehensive and satisfactory method of analysis than that based simply upon mean word-length suggested itself. The new method, while scarcely more laborious than that proposed by De Morgan, promised to yield results more quickly and of a definitely higher order. It also had the advantage of including, in its application, all that was necessary to the determination of mean word-length; so that, in reality, it furnished two distinct tests.</p></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><p>Preliminary trials of the method have furnished strong grounds for the belief that it may prove useful as a method of analysis leading to identification or discrimination of authorship, and it is therefore brought to the attention of the scientific and literary public in the hope that some one may be found who is at once able and willing to secure a satisfactory test of its validity.</p></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><p>The nature of the process is extremely simple, but it may be useful to point out its similarity to a well-known method of material analysis, the consideration of which actually first suggested to the writer its literary analogue.</p></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><p>By the use of the spectroscope, a beam of non-homogeneous light is analyzed, and its components assorted according to their wave-length. As is well known, each element,when intensely heated under proper conditions, sends forth light which, upon prismatic analysis, is found to consist of groups of waves of definite length, and appearing  in certain definite proportions. So certain and uniform are the results of this analysis, that the appearance of a particular spectrum is indisputable evidence of the presence of the element to which it belongs.</p></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><p>In a manner very similar, it is proposed to analyze a composition by forming what may be called a 'word-spectrum,' or ' characteristic curve,' which shall be a graphic representation of an arrangement of words according to their length and to the relative frequency of their occurrence. If, now, it shall be found that with every author, as with every element, this spectrum persists in its form and appearance, the value of the method will be at once conceded. It has been proved that the spectrum of hydrogen is the same, whether that element is obtained from the water of the ocean or from the vapor of the atmosphere. Wherever and whenever it appears, it means hydrogen. If it can be proved that the word-spectrum or characteristic curve exhibited by an analysis of 'David Copperfield' is identical with that of 'Oliver Twist', of 'Barnaby Rudge,' of 'Great Expectations,' of the 'Child's history of England,' etc., and that it differs sensibly from that of 'Vanity fair,' or 'Eugene Aram,' or 'Robinson Crusoe,' or 'Don Quixote,' or any thing else in fact, then the conclusion will be tolerably certain that when it appears it means Dickens.</p></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><p>The validity of the method as a test of authorship, then, implies the following assumptions: that every writer makes use of a vocabulary which is peculiar to himself, and the character of which does not materially change from year to year during his productive period; that, in the use of that vocabulary in composition, personal peculiarities in the construction of sentences will, in the long-run, recur with such regularity that short words, long words, and words of medium length, will occur with definite relative frequencies.</p></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><p>The first assumption will, perhaps, be admitted in a general way, without debate. It is easily seen that to prove or disprove the second will require the expenditure of an enormous amount of labor. The following results are offered as a means of properly exhibiting the method, and as evidence, in some degree at least, of its real value.</p></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><p>It is important, first, to determine to what extent an author may be said to agree with himself; and, second, to what extent does he differ from others.<p></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><p>As an instance in which two writers might well be expected to greatly resemble each other in their curves, and consequently as a severe test of the method, two contemporaneous novelists, Dickens and Thackeray, were selected for the first examination. The operation consisted simply in counting the number of letters in every word, and recording the number of words of one letter, two letters, three letters, etc. The count began in both cases at the beginning of the volume, and, after a few thousand words had been counted in order, the book was opened at random near the middle, and the count continued. In no case was any personal choice exercised, except that both counts began with the first chapter. Words were counted always in groups of one thousand. The graphic display of the result was made by the common method of rectangular co-ordinates, using the number of letters in a word as an abscissa, and the corresponding number of such words in a thousand as an ordinate. As an illustration, the first one thousand words counted from 'Oliver Twist' may be cited; they were as follows:-</p></div>
[TABLE_1]
<div style="text-align: justify;"><p>Even in so small a number as one thousand, the relative distribution of words is approximately the same as in a much larger number, although, as would naturally be expected, accidental variations or 'runs' overshadow personal characteristics to a great extent; but not completely, as will be seen in the characteristic curves shown in the following pages. In fact, when the ten groups, of a thousand words each, from Dickens, are compared with ten similar groups from John Stuart Mill, no one of the first set could by any possibility be mistaken for any one of the second.</p></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><p>The graphic representation of the results will be readily understood. It is only necessary to take a sheet of 'squared' paper, or paper ruled in two directions at right angles to each other, and, after placing the numbers showing letters in each word at points along a horizontal line separated from each other by equal distances, above each of these place other points whose distance from the base line shall be proportional to the number of such words in a thousand; then join these points by a broken line, and the characteristic curve is shown. Fig. 1 shows the curve thus constructed from the first thousand words in 'Oliver Twist,' the numerical analysis of which is shown above.</p></div>
<div style="text-align: center;"><p><i>Fig. 1 - First one thousand words in Oliver Twist.</i></p></div>
[FIGURE_1]
<div style="text-align: justify;"><p>The next diagram (<i>fig. 2</i>) exhibits five curves constructed from the first five thousand words the same from work, in groups of one thousand each. It is presented in order to show the variation among groups based on a relatively small number of words.</p></div>
<div style="text-align: center;"><p><i> Fig. 2 - Showing five groups, of one thousand words each, from 'Oliver Twist'.</i></p></div>
[FIGURE_2]
<div style="text-align: justify;"><p>The superiority of this method over that of simple word averages, as suggested by DeMorgan, is clearly shown in fig. 3, which exhibits two consecutive groups, of one thousand words each, from 'Vanity fair.' The numerical analysis of these groups is as follows:-</p></div>
[TABLE_2]
<div style="text-align: center;"><p><i>Fig. 3 - Two consecutive groups, of one thousand words each, from 'Vanity Fair'. These groups show sensibly the same average word-lengths.</i></p></div>
[FIGURE_3]
<div style="text-align: justify;"><p>It will be seen that the total number of letters in the first group is 4,507, and in the second 4,508, or an average of 4.507 and 4.508 letters to each word in the respective groups. If this average, or 'mean word-length,' be alone considered, the two groups must be regarded as sensibly identical; but an inspection of the diagram shows that they are in reality quite different.</p></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><p>When the number of words in a group is increased to five thousand, the accidental irregularities begin to disappear, the curve becomes smoother, approximating more nearly to the normal curve which, it is assumed, is characteristic of the writer. Fig. 4 exhibits two groups, each of five thousand words, from 'Oliver Twist,' and it will be seen that considerable differences still exist. One of the curves shows an excess of nine-letter words, which does not appear in the other. They agree in showing a greater number of six-letter words than a smooth curve would demand. This excess may persist, and prove to be a real characteristic of Dickens's composition. Fig. 5 exhibits these two groups of five thousand words combined in one of ten thousand, giving a curve of greater smoothness, and approximating still more closely to the normal curve of the writer.</p></div>

[FIGURE_4]
<div style="text-align: center;"><p><i>Fig. 5 - Curve for ten thousand words from 'Oliver Twist'.</i></p></div>
[FIGURE_5]
<div style="text-align: justify;"><p>In fig. 6, two groups of five thousand words each, from 'Vanity fair,' are shown; and in fig. 7, two groups of ten thousand each, from 'Oliver Twist' and 'Vanity fair,' are placed side by side for comparison, the former being represented by the continuous line, and the latter by the broken line. Although these curves differ, and while it is believed that the difference will persist with an increased number of words, it is certainly surprising, that in the analysis of ten thousand words from Dickens, and the same number from Thackeray, so close an agreement should be found. This agreement is particularly striking in words of eleven, twelve, and thirteen letters, the numerical comparison of which is as follows:-</p></div>
[TABLE_3]

[FIGURE_6]
<div style="text-align: center;"><p><i>Fig. 7 - Two groups, of ten thousand words each, from 'Oliver Twist,' &mdash;; and from 'Vanity Fair', - - -.</i></p></div>
[FIGURE_7]
<div style="text-align: justify;"><p>This closeness to identity must be largely the result of accident, and it would not be likely to repeat itself in another analysis.</p></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><p>The writer next examined was John Stuart Mill; and to test the persistence of form in compositions belonging to different periods of the author's life, and upon different subjects, two groups of five thousand words each were taken, - one from his 'Political economy,' and the other from his 'Essay on liberty.' It was anticipated, of course, that words of greater length would occur far more frequently than in the case of the novelists; but I confess to considerable surprise on finding from the very beginning, that although, on the whole, this anticipation was realized, the word which occurred most frequently was not the three-letter word, as with both Dickens and Thackeray, but the word of two letters. Indeed, the word of two letters was not only relatively more frequent, but absolutely; that is to say, it occurred more frequently in the composition of Mill than in that of either of the novelists, and with great uniformity, as it was in excess in each thousand of the ten analyzed. The explanation is easy, and is to be found in the liberal use of prepositions in sentence-building. The proposed method of analysis is designed to reveal any peculiarity of this kind, and the exemplification of its power thus early in the work was encouraging.</p></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><p>Figs. 8 and 9 show the curves for five thousand words from the 'Political economy' and from the 'Essay on liberty.' It will be observed, that, while they differ considerably, there is still, in a general way, a striking resemblance, and that they are in marked contrast with the curves of the novelists. An interesting case was furnished in two recent addresses on the labor question by Mr. Edward Atkinson. In reality, one address was given to two very different audiences. One was made up from the workingmen of Providence, and the other from the alumni of the Andover theological seminary. On reading the two, one cannot avoid being struck by the marked difference in style, although the two papers are much alike in substance. It was interesting, then, to inquire whether their curves of composition would show any marked resemblance. An analysis of five thousand words from each paper was made, and the result is shown in fig. 10. A very satisfactory, indeed a striking, general resemblance will be observed; and it will also be seen that Mr. Atkinson's curve differs decidedly from others previously figured and described. It is shown in contrast with that of John Stuart Mill in fig. 11. Mr. Atkinson's composition is remarkable in respect to the shortness of the words used.  The average length of ten thousand words in his addresses on the labor question is 4.298 letters. The mean word-length of the writers thus far examined. based upon a count of ten thousand words from each, is as follows:-</p></div>

[FIGURE 11]
<div style="text-align: justify;"><p>A friend has furnished me with the result of the count of the first five thousand five hundred words of Caesar's 'Commentaries.' The mean word-length is 6.065. The most extensive word-counting that I know of is that of the words and letters in the Bible. I cannot vouch for the reliability of the information which periodically floats through the columns of the public press, that the Old Testament contains 592,493 words with 2,728,- 100 letters, and the New Testament 181.253 words with 838,380 letters. It is interesting to note, however, that these numbers give averages of 4.604 and 4.625 respectively, agreeing withii less than one-half of one per cent.</p></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><p>Before making an analysis of Mr. Atkinson's composition, and after having counted more than thirty thousand from other writers, I had concluded that a group of one thousand words whose average length was less than four letters would not occur, except in compositions especially written in short words. Out of ten such groups from Mr. Atkinson's addresses, however, one was found whose mean word-length was 3.991. I have recently received from him a brief paper, entitled 'How do we all get a living?' which was published in Work and wages, and in the preparation of which he made a special effort to use the simplest language possible. The article contains a little more than two thousand words, the number being too small for the construction of a curve which would be comparable with those already exhibited. The general form of one based upon two thousand words is similar to that previously obtained from the same writer, and the mean word-length is 3.771.</p></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><p>Interesting evidence of the validity of this method of analysis and identification has been furnished by several friends who have had the patience to enumerate the letters in many thou- sand words from different sources. Prof. Stanley Coulter sends me the result of a count of ten thousand from Dickens's 'Christmas carol.' He writes. "I became exceedingly interested in watching how little tricks of composition affected the 'curve.' For instance, one of the characters, 'Scrooge,' appears in one place very often, and an excess of 7's is the result; in another place Fizziwig,' and the 8's creep up [this is doubtless owing to the frequent appearance of the names]. Other variations and excesses seem to come from Dickens's love of certain forms of description, which he iterates and reiterates upon a single page."</p></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><p>I have plotted these ten thousand words from the 'Carol' with the ten thousand already shown from 'Oliver Twist,' in fig. 12. A very close resemblance will be observed, and it will be noticed that the mean of these two curves would be free from certain irregularities which occur in both, and would be a much closer approximation to the normal characteristic curve of Dickens.</p></div>
<div style="text-align: center;"><p><i>Fig. 12 - Two groups, of ten thousand words each, from Dickens: 'Oliver Twist,' &mdash;; 'Christmas Carol,' - - -.</i></p></div>
[FIGURE 12]
<div style="text-align: justify;"><p>It is hardly necessary to say that the method is not necessarily confined to the analysis of a com- position by means of its mean word-length: it may equally well be applied to the study of syllables, of words in sentences, and in various other ways. The results thus far obtained from its application would appear to justify the claim that it is worthy of a thorough test through which the validity of its assumptions might be proved or disproved. Its principal merits are, that it offers a means of investigating and displaying the mere mechanism of composition, and that it is purely mechanical in its application. In virtue of the first, it might reveal characteristics which a writer would make no attempt to conceal, being himself unaware of their existence; and, of the second, the conclusions reached through its use would be independent of personal bias, the work of one person in the study of an author being at once comparable with that of any other.</p></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><p>Many interesting applications of the process will suggest themselves to every reader; the most notable, of course, being the attempt to solve questions of disputed authorship, such as exist in reference to the letters of Junius, the plays of Shakspeare, and other less widely known examples. It might also be utilized in comparative language studies, in tracing the growth of a language, in studying the growth of the vocabulary from childhood to manhood, and in other directions too numerous to be catalogued. An illustration of its application to another language is shown in the analysis of more than five thousand words in Caesar's 'Commentaries,' already referred to, which is represented in fig. 13. The curve shows a relatively large use of long words, and its peculiar feature is the evident indication of two maximum ordinates nearly equal to each other.</p></div>
<div style="text-align: center;"><p><i>Fig. 13 - Group of five thousand five hundred words from Caesar's 'Commentaries'.</i></p></div>
[FIGURE 13]
<div style="text-align: justify;"><p>From the examinations thus far made, I am convinced that one hundred thousand words will be necessary and sufficient to furnish the characteristic curve of a writer, - that is to say, if a curve is constructed from one hundred thousand words of a writer, taken from any one of his productions, then a second curve constructed from another hundred thousand words would be practically identical with the first, - and that this curve would, in general, differ from that formed in the same way from the composition of another writer, to such an extent that one could always be distinguished from the other. To demonstrate the  existence of such a curve will require the enumeration of the letters in several hundred thousand words from each of a number of writers. Should its existence be established, the method might then be applied to cases of disputed authorship. If striking differences are found between the curves of known and suspected compositions of any writer, the evidence against identity of authorship would be quite conclusive. If the two compositions should produce curves which are practically identical, the proof of a common origin would be less convincing; for it is possible, al- though not probable, that two writers might show identical characteristic curves.</p></div>

<div style="text-align: center;"><p><h2><b>APPENDIX A: Augustus De Morgan, Letter to Heald (1851)</b></h2></p></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><p>To Rev. W. Heald. 7 Camden Street, Aug. 18, 1851.</p></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><p>... I wish you would do this: run your eye over any part of those of St. Paul's Epistles which begin with Пavλos- the Greek, I mean - and without paying any attention to the meaning. Then do the same with the Epistle to the Hebrews, and try to balance in your own mind the question whether the latter does not deal in longer words than the former. It has always run in my head that a little expenditure of money would settle questions of authorship in this way. The best mode of explaining what I would try will be to put down the results I should expect as if I had tried them.</p></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><p>Count a large number of words in Herodotus- say all the first book and count all the letters; divide the second numbers by the first, giving the average number of letters to a word in that book.</p></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><p>Do the same with the second book. I should expect a very close approximation. If Book I gave 5.624 letters per word, it would not surprise me if Book II gave 5.619. I judge by other things.</p></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><p>But I should not wonder if the same result applied to two books of Thucydides gave, say 5.713 and 5.728. That is to say, I should expect the slight differences between one writer and another to be well maintained against each other, and very well agreeing with themselves. If this fact were established there, if St. Paul's Epistles which begin with Пavλos gave 5.428 and the Hebrews gave 5.516, for instance, I should feel quite sure that the Greek of the Hebrews (passing no verdict on whether Paul wrote in Hebrew and another translated) was not from the pen of Paul.</p></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><p>If scholars knew the law of averages as well as mathematicians, it would be easy to raise a few hundred pounds to try this experiment on a grand scale. I would have Greek, Latin, and English tried, and I should expect to find that one man writing on two different subjects agrees more nearly with himself than two different men writing on the same subject. Some of these days spurious writings will be detected by this test. Mind, I told you so.</p></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><p>With kind regards to all your family, I remain, dear Heald, yours sincerely, A. DE MORGAN</p></div>
